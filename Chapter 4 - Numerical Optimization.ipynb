    "*This is a series of blog posts on the [Deep Learning book](http://deeplearningbook.org) where I am attempting to provide a summary of each chapter highlighting the concepts that I found to be most important so that other people can use it as a starting point for reading the chapters, while including the code for reproducing some of the results. Please refer [this](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/notation.html) for more clarity on notation.*\n",

    "Since you are here, there's a high probability that you must have heard of **Gradient Descent**. It is that part of a Deep Learning pipeline which leads to the model being *trained*. This chapter outlines the various kinds of numerical computations generally utilized by Machine Learning algorithms and also describes various optimization algorithms (e.g. Gradient Descent, Newton's method), which are those class of algorithms that update the estimates of the solution iteratively, rather than solving it analytically to provide a closed-form solution.\n",
