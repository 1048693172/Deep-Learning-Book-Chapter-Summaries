    "Recalling from Chapter 5, **overfitting** is said to occur when the training error keeps decreasing but the test error (or the generalization error) starts increasing. **Regularization** is the modification we make to a learning algorithm that reduces its generalization error, but not its training error. There are various ways of doing this, some of which include restriction on parameter values or adding terms to the objective function, etc.\n",

    "### 2. Norm penalties as constrained optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "From chapter 4's section 4, we know that to minimize any function under some constraints, we can construct a generalized Lagrangian function containing the objective function along with the penalties. Suppose we wanted $\\Omega(\\theta)) < k$, then we could construct the following Lagrangian:\n",
    "![lagrangian](images/lagrangian.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, $\\theta^* = argmin_{\\theta} (max_{\\alpha, \\alpha >= 0} \\hspace{.2cm} \\mathcal{L}(\\theta, \\alpha; X, y))$. If  $\\Omega(\\theta) > k$, then $\\alpha$ should be large to reduce its value below k. <br>\n",
    "Likewise, if $\\Omega(\\theta) < k$, then $\\alpha$ should be small. Assuming $\\alpha$ to be a constant $\\alpha^{*}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\theta^* = argmin_{\\theta} \\hspace{.2cm} J(\\theta; X, y) + \\alpha^* \\Omega(\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is now similar to the parameter norm penalty regularized objective function. Thus, parameter norm penalties naturally impose a constraint, like the L2-regularization defining a constrained L2-ball. Larger $\\alpha$ means a smaller constrained region and vice versa. The idea of constraints over penalties, is important for several reasons. Penalties might cause non-convex optimization algorithms to get stuck in local minima due to small values of $\\theta$, leading to the formation of so-called `dead cells`, as the weights entering and leaving them are too small to have an impact. Constraints don't enforce the weights to be near zero, rather being confined to a constrained region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason is that constraints induce higher stability. With higher learning rates, there might be a large weight, leading to a large gradient, which could go on iteratively leading to numerical overflow in the value of $\\theta$. Constrains along with reprojection (to the corresponding ball) prevent the weights from becoming too large, thus, maintaining stability. \n",
    "\n",
    "A final suggestion made by Hinton was to restrict the individual column norms of the weight matrix rather than the Frobenius norm of the entire weight matrix, so as to prevent any hidden unit from having a large weight."
